Yes, you can definitely learn multiple topics in parallel, like a student learning different subjects at school. This approach will help you maintain a diverse skill set and avoid burnout from focusing too much on a single topic. Since you're planning to dedicate **4 hours per day, 7 days a week** to your learning journey, I can break this down into a detailed roadmap. I'll also suggest whether you should take online courses or if you can rely on YouTube content, as well as where to find communities for interaction.
