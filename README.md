# vs-code-clone-html-css
This project is a front-end clone of the official Visual Studio Code homepage. It was built using HTML5 and CSS3 to replicate the layout, design, and responsiveness of VS Code's main landing page. The project focuses on clean code structure, pixel-perfect UI recreation, and basic responsive behavior for various screen sizes.
